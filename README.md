Helpful utilities for UIColor

I forked this 7 year old project because the utilities intrigued me. I appreciate the convenience of the methods that choose colors for you, especially:

####contrastingColor
Excellent for keeping your text legible, no matter what the background.

####complementaryColor
and
####triadicColors
Gives you the sibling colors you need.

####randomColor
Nice treat to throw in the bag, great for testing.

UPDATE: Updated the example project, as well as original utilities, for iOS 9.x
